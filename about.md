## About Me

A proactive, organised and self-motivated professional with strong problem-solving and communication skills and communicate with clarity and patience, even when faced with challenging customers.

A people person and an empathic listener. I like to explain IT related topics to non-IT colleagues or customers in jargon less language and take pride in sharing my knowledge. 

As an active learner, I quickly adapt to new technologies and master new processes, consistently maintaining high standards of process adherence.

In my previous roles, I have used various systems (document processing, payment systems, MS office applications) and have experience guiding colleagues in using these applications.


My background includes:
- International trade finance document processing and their payments processing.
- Producing reports and dashboards for regulatory reporting.
- Supporting application users and resolving their login issues and explaining the usage of the application.
- Understanding social housing processes such as repairs, rents, compliance, and tenancy management.
- Using Excel and SQL to analyse and validate data.
- Understanding of BACS Direct Debits.
- Understandig of Project Management.
